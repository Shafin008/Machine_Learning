    "\n",
    "### Measures of center: mean\n",

    "\n",
    "### Measures of center: median\n",

    "Another measure of center is the `median`. The median is the value where `50% of the data is lower than it, and 50% of the data is higher`. We can calculate this by `sorting` all the data points and taking the `middle` one.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Measures of center: mode\n",
