    "### The normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The next probability distribution we'll discuss is the normal distribution. It's one of the most important probability distributions you'll learn about since a countless number of statistical methods rely on it, and it applies to more real-world situations than the distributions we've covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the normal distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution looks like this. Its shape is commonly referred to as a \"bell curve\". \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nd.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution has a few important properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Symmetrical`: First, it's symmetrical, so the left side is a mirror image of the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Area = 1`: Second, just like any continuous distribution, the area beneath the curve is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Curve never hits 0`: The probability never hits 0, even if it looks like it does at the tail ends. Only 0.006% of its area is contained beyond the edges of this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Described by mean and standard deviation`: The normal distribution is described by its mean and standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nd-1.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here is a normal distribution with a mean of 20 and standard deviation of 3, and here is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. \n",
    "    \n",
    "When a normal distribution has mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1, it's a special distribution called the `standard normal distribution` Notice how both distributions have the same shape, but their axes have different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Areas under the normal distribution`: For the normal distribution, `68%` of the area is within `1 standard deviation` of the mean. `95%` of the area falls within `2 standard deviations` of the mean,and `99.7%`of the area falls within `3 standard deviations`. This is sometimes called the `68-95-99.7` rule."

    "### Central limit theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon is known as the central limit theorem, which states that a sampling distribution will approach a normal distribution as the number of trials increases. In our example, the sampling distribution became closer to the normal distribution as we took more and more sample means. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"clt.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the central limit theorem only applies when samples are taken randomly and are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard deviation and the CLT\n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem, or CLT, applies to other summary statistics as well. If we take the standard deviation of 5 rolls 1000 times, the sample standard deviations are distributed normally, centered around 1.9, which is the distribution's standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"clt-1.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proportions and the CLT\n",
    "\n",
    "Another statistic that the CLT applies to is proportion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's sample from the sales team 10 times with replacement and see how many draws have Claire as the outcome. In this case, 10% of draws were Claire. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"clt-2.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If we draw again, there are 40% Claires.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Sampling distribution of proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "If we repeat this 1000 times and plot the distribution of the sample proportions, it resembles a normal distribution centered around 0-point-25, since Claire's name was on 25% of the tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"clt-3.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean of sampling distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these sampling distributions are normal, we can take their mean to get an estimate of a distribution's mean, standard deviation, or proportion. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"clt-4.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the mean of our sample means from earlier, we get 3.48. That's pretty close to the expected value, which is 3.5! \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the mean of the sample proportions of Claires isn't far off from 0.25. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, we know what the underlying distributions look like, but if we don't, this can be a useful method for estimating characteristics of an underlying distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem also comes in handy when you have a huge population and don't have the time or resources to collect data on everyone. Instead, you can collect several smaller samples and create a sampling distribution to estimate what the mean or standard deviation is."
